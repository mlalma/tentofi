This repository contains various blockchain / smart contract projects:

- **DTDEngine**: Decentralised Token Repository smart contract to help clearing and settling bespoke bilateral OTC instruments between counterparties
- **Index**: Smart contract for creating and tracking indices to measure the performance of an underlying in derivatives' contracts. The source for an index can be e.g. a single price index of an asset or multiple assets (basket). The index value can be spot price, best-of / worst-of / average in baskets or calculated from the multiple source spot values (e.g. variance or TWAP). Supports "index marking" for path dependent instruments
