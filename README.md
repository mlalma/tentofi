This repository contains various blockchain / smart contract projects:

- **DTDEngine**: Decentralised Token Repository smart contract to help clearing and settling bespoke bilateral OTC instruments between counterparties
- **IndexFactory**: Smart contract for creating and tracking indices used to measure the performance of an underlying in a derivatives contract. The source for an index can be as simple as a spot price of an asset or multpile (basket) of assets. The index value can simply be a spot price, best-of / worst-of / average in baskets or something calculate from the source (e.g. volatility or variance). Supports "index marking" for path dependent instruments
